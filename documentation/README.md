# Welcome to the COCAsync Documentation!

## Introduction
COCAsync is an asynchronous python wrapper for the Clash Of Clans API. It has been designed very heavily object-oriented to give users the best experience possible. *insert more stuff that doesn't really help you with learning the wrapper at all that you'll probably just gloss over here*

## Installation
Type `pip install cocasync` or `python -m pip install cocasync` into your console (one of them should work).

To update cocasync use the -U flag (`pip install -U cocasync` or `python -m pip install -U cocasync`)
