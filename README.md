# COCAsync
Welcome to COCAsync! COCAsync is an asynchronous python wrapper for the [Clash of Clans API](https://developer.clashofclans.com/). As of right now I have just finished writing the wrapper so I am super burned out- but I assure you that this file, docs, and examples are all coming soon. If you have any questions, make sure to hop into our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/QtsJbqu/), and remember to SMASH THAT STAR BUTTON (lol jk)!!

##### Special thanks to [@SharpBit](https://github.com/sharpbit) for sticking with me the entire way, giving me tips, and not getting annoyed when I kept bothering him.
